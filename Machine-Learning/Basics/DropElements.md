Great question 👍 You want to **exclude categorical columns** from your dataset (keep only numerical ones).

In **Pandas**, categorical columns usually have `dtype = object` (strings) or sometimes `category`.

---

### ✅ Ways to exclude categorical columns:

#### 1. Using `select_dtypes` (most common)

```python
X_numeric = X_full.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])
```

* Drops all `object` type columns (strings).
* Keeps integers and floats only.

👉 If some columns are explicitly marked as `category` type:

```python
X_numeric = X_full.select_dtypes(exclude=['object', 'category'])
```

---

#### 2. Keep only numerical dtypes directly

```python
X_numeric = X_full.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64'])
```

* Keeps only integer and float columns.
* Explicitly tells Pandas what you want.

---

#### 3. Drop categorical columns by `df.dtypes`

```python
X_numeric = X_full.drop(columns=X_full.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns)
```

* First selects object columns,
* Then drops them from the dataset.

---

### ✅ Example

Suppose:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'LotArea': [8450, 9600, 11250],
    'Street': ['Pave', 'Pave', 'Grvl'],  # categorical
    'OverallQual': [7, 6, 7],
    'Neighborhood': ['CollgCr', 'Veenker', 'CollgCr']  # categorical
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

* Original:

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

```
LotArea          int64
Street          object
OverallQual      int64
Neighborhood    object
```

* Keep only numeric:

```python
df_numeric = df.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])
print(df_numeric)
```

```
   LotArea  OverallQual
0     8450            7
1     9600            6
2    11250            7
```

---

⚖️ **In summary:**

* Use `select_dtypes(exclude=['object', 'category'])` → safest way.
* Or use `include=['int64','float64']` if you only want numerical.

Yes! ✅ What you’re doing here:

```python
reduced_X_train = X_train.dropna(axis=1)
reduced_X_valid = X_valid.dropna(axis=1)
```

* Drops **all columns that have at least one missing value** (`axis=1` = columns).
* Only keeps columns **without any missing values**.

This is a **simpler alternative to imputation**, but it can be risky if you lose too many columns.

---

### Another Methods You Can Use Instead of Dropping Columns

#### 1. **Imputation (fill missing values)**

* Fill missing values using **mean, median, mode, or a constant**.
* Keeps all columns instead of dropping them.

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')  # or median
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_valid = pd.DataFrame(imputer.transform(X_valid))

# restore column names
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns
imputed_X_valid.columns = X_valid.columns
```

✅ Advantage: You don’t lose information by dropping columns.

---

#### 2. **Drop columns with too many missing values only**

* Sometimes, only a few columns have lots of missing values.
* Drop **columns with >50% missing**, and impute the rest.

```python
threshold = 0.5  # 50% missing allowed
cols_to_keep = X_train.columns[X_train.isnull().mean() < threshold]
X_train_reduced = X_train[cols_to_keep]
X_valid_reduced = X_valid[cols_to_keep]
```

---

#### 3. **Drop rows with missing values**

* Sometimes better if **few rows** have missing data.

```python
X_train_reduced = X_train.dropna(axis=0)
y_train_reduced = y_train[X_train_reduced.index]  # adjust target accordingly
```

* But don’t do this if many rows have missing values — you’ll lose data.

---

#### 4. **Advanced: Use models that handle missing values natively**

* Some models like **XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost** can handle missing values directly without imputation.
* This avoids dropping columns or filling them manually.

---

⚖️ **Summary:**

* `dropna(axis=1)` → removes all columns with missing values (easy but can lose info).
* **Better options**: impute missing values or drop only columns with too many missing values.

If you want, I can make a **side-by-side example showing: drop columns vs imputation vs thresholding**, so you can see which preserves more data.
