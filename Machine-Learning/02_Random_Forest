Reason: Randomness is used inside the Random Forest algorithm itself, not just in splitting data.

Bootstrap sampling (bagging):

For each tree, Random Forest doesn’t use the entire training set.

Instead, it randomly samples (with replacement) from the training data to build each tree.

So Tree 1, Tree 2, Tree 3… all see different versions of the training set.

🔹 This randomness ensures trees are diverse, not all identical.

Random feature selection at each split:

When a tree splits a node, it doesn’t look at all features.

It randomly selects a subset of features, then chooses the best split among those.

This prevents trees from always choosing the same strong features.

🔹 Again, this increases diversity.

Why is this randomness important?

If all trees were trained on the same data with the same features, they’d be identical.

Then the “forest” would collapse into just one big tree (no real benefit).

Randomness makes trees different, and when we average/vote their results, we reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

Role of random_state here:

Controls the random seeds used for:

bootstrap sampling,

random feature selection,

and sometimes shuffling.

If fixed → you get reproducible trees.

If not fixed → you get slightly different forests each time.

⚖️ So even after splitting train/test, randomness is still crucial inside Random Forest to make trees diverse.







In Random Forest, both types of randomness happen — but at different stages:

1. Random samples → different trees (Bootstrap Sampling 🪵🌳)

Each tree is trained on a random sample of the training dataset (with replacement).

Example:

Suppose you have 1000 training points.

Each tree gets ~1000 samples but drawn randomly (some points may repeat, some may be missing).

So Tree 1, Tree 2, Tree 3… all see slightly different data.

👉 This is called Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation).

2. Random features → different splits inside trees (Feature Subsampling 🌿)

Even within one tree, when splitting a node:

Instead of checking all features (like a normal Decision Tree),

Random Forest only checks a subset of features.

Example:

If dataset has 20 features, maybe only 5 random features are considered at a split.

At the next split, another random subset is chosen.

👉 This makes trees more diverse, prevents dominance of a few strong features.

So the answer:

✅ Random samples go to different trees (bagging).
✅ Random features are used inside each tree (at every split).

Both together create decorrelated trees, and averaging them reduces variance → better accuracy.

⚖️ Think of it like this:

Random samples → different students taking different practice questions.

Random features → each student solves problems using only some of the available formulas.
When you combine their answers, you get a strong overall solution.
