Great question 👍 Let’s go step by step.

# 🔍 **What is Data Leakage in Machine Learning?**

👉 **Definition:**
Data leakage happens when **information from outside the training dataset sneaks into the model during training**, giving it **unfair or unrealistic knowledge** that would not be available in real-world prediction time.

This causes the model to look **very accurate during training/validation**, but it fails badly on unseen data.

---

# ⚡ Types of Data Leakage

### 1. **Target Leakage (Label Leakage)**

* When information about the **target variable (y)** is accidentally included in the features (X).
* Example: Predicting whether a loan will default, but one of your features is “loan\_paid\_off” → this is basically the answer.

---

### 2. **Train-Test Contamination**

* When the test set indirectly influences training.
* Example: You scale/normalize the entire dataset **before splitting** into train and test. The test set statistics leak into training.
* Proper way → fit scaler on train set only, then apply to test.

---

### 3. **Temporal Leakage (Future Information)**

* When future data is used to predict the past or present.
* Example: Predicting whether a customer will cancel subscription using their **future monthly activity** → unrealistic because at prediction time we don’t know the future.

---

# 🏦 **Simple Examples**

### ✅ Example of Leakage

You want to predict whether a patient will be diagnosed with diabetes.
Features include:

* Blood sugar level
* Weight
* Age
* **Doctor’s final diagnosis report** (❌ leakage – this is the target itself)

The model would get **99% accuracy** but be useless in real life.

---

### ✅ Example of Train-Test Contamination

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# ❌ Wrong way (leakage)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)   # using full dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2)

# ✅ Correct way
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)   # fit only on train
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

---

# 🚨 Why It’s Dangerous

* Inflated accuracy/precision/recall scores during training.
* Model fails completely on deployment.
* Hard to detect sometimes because it looks like the model is “too good.”

---

# ✅ How to Avoid Data Leakage

1. **Split train/test early** and do all preprocessing only on the training set.
2. **Carefully review features** to ensure none of them reveal target information.
3. **Watch out for time-series** → never use future data to predict the past.
4. **Pipeline properly** in Scikit-learn (`Pipeline`) so preprocessing doesn’t leak.

---

👉 In short: **Data leakage = your model is cheating.**
It learns from information it shouldn’t have, so performance metrics lie.

---




Excellent doubt 👌 This is **the heart of data leakage prevention**. Let’s break it slowly.

---

# ⚡ Why Scale Only the Training Set (not full dataset)?

When you scale (normalize/standardize), you compute some statistics:

* **StandardScaler** → needs mean (μ) and std (σ)
* **MinMaxScaler** → needs min and max
* etc.

If you scale the **entire dataset before splitting**, then:

* The **test set’s information leaks** into training.
* The model indirectly “knows” about unseen data.
* Your reported accuracy is **unrealistically high**.

---

## 🔍 Example (Numerical)

Suppose we have 10 data points (ages):

```
[18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 30, 60, 65, 70]
```

Now let’s say we want to split into:

* Train = first 8 values
* Test = last 2 values

---

### ❌ Wrong Way (scaling full dataset first)

* Mean (μ) of full data = 36.1
* Std (σ) of full data = 18.3

When scaling train, you already used info from `[65, 70]` (test).
So training “knows” the test distribution → **leakage**.

---

### ✅ Correct Way (fit scaler on train only)

* Mean (μ) of train = 28.25
* Std (σ) of train = 13.3

Now scale train with these values,
then apply same μ, σ to test.

The model **never saw test distribution** → realistic evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Real-world Intuition

Imagine you’re predicting house prices in 2025.
If you scale with the **entire dataset (train + future test houses)**, you’re using **future price information** to normalize past data.

That’s cheating, because in reality, when making predictions in 2025, you don’t know about future houses.

---

# ✅ General Rule

* **Always compute preprocessing parameters (mean, std, min, max, etc.) only from the training data.**
* **Apply the same transformation to the test data.**
* This mimics the real world → when the model is deployed, new unseen data should be scaled based on the training distribution only.

---

👉 So, scaling full dataset before splitting = **future knowledge leaks in**.
Scaling train only = **realistic deployment scenario**.

IMPORTANT NOTE-


Even with few missing values, dropping columns can sometimes work better than imputation. This may be due to noise or because the chosen imputation method (like mean/median) doesn’t fit the data. For example, missing values in GarageYrBlt might mean no garage, so filling with 0 or median may not make sense. Always choose imputation based on what the column represents.
